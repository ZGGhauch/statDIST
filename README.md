# Statistical Distances 

## About
This Python package provides a comprehensive list of statistical distances (i.e. metrics and divergences) methods used in the statistics and machine learning domain. The statistical measures can used to measure the distance between probability distributions. The Python package consists a few of classes containing methods for computing statistical distance metrics between two random variables, two probability distributions, or two samples, or a distance between a sample point and a population. 
    
Supported distance measures include:
        
+ Energy distance
+ Mahalanobis distance
+ Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence
+ Renyi divergence
+ Variational distance
+ Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance
+ Maximum Mean Discrepancy distance
+ Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion
